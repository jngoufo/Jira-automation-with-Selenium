**Project description**<br>This project, "Jira-automation-with-Selenium," is a robust framework designed to automate common user tasks within the JIRA web interface. It leverages Python and Selenium to create script-based test cases, serving as an excellent resource for enhancing technical skills in test automation.<br><br>**Objective**<br>The core objective of this project is to streamline and automate user interaction tests with JIRA, reducing manual effort for repetitive tasks. It adopts a hybrid architectural approach, combining the "Page Object Model" (POM) for better maintainability and readability of test scripts, with a "Data-driven" methodology to allow for flexible test data management. This combination ensures that the automation framework is both scalable and easy to manage.<br><br>**Technologies Used**<br><ul><li><b>Python:</b> The primary programming language used for developing the automation scripts.</li><li><b>Selenium:</b> A powerful tool for automating web browsers, enabling interaction with the JIRA web interface.</li><li><b>Excel:</b> for managing test data in a data-driven approach, allowing test cases to be executed with various inputs stored in spreadsheet format.</li></ul><b>Project Structure</b><br>The repository is organized into several key directories to maintain a clear and modular structure, typical for a Selenium automation framework:<ul><li><i>base</i> includes common librairies or methods used across different parts of the framework.</li><li><i>configfiles</i> includes configuration files for the project, such as test environment settings.</li><li><i>pages</i> implements the "Page Object Model," with each file representing a specific page or component of the JIRA application, containing methods that interact with elements on that page.</li><li><i>reports</i> stores the test reports automatically generated after execution of the test cases.</li><li><i>screenshots</i> stores the screen captures, in case screenshots are necessary on test failure.</li><li><i>testcases</i> contains the actual test scripts or automation flows that perform actions on JIRA</li><li><i>testdata</i> stores the Excel or CSV files, depending on how we use test data in the project</li><li><i>utilities</i> provides custom scripts that support the test cases.</li><li><i>README.md</i>, this file, provides an overview of the project.</li></ul>
